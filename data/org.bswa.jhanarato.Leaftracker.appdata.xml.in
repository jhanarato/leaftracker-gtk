    <p>
      This is a GTK user interface for my DDD project, Leaftracker. Given that the Leaftracker system uses
      Elasticsearch for storage, it&apos;s not entirely practical for the average user who just wants to take care of
      their garden. Instead it&apos;s for my personal exploration of user interface design.
